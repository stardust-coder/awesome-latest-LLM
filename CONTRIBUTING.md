Please avoid adding small derivatives or unverified models.

2. Improve descriptions

Clearer summaries, corrected details, or additional context are appreciated.

3. Add or refine categories

If a new category is emerging (e.g., “Video-first Models”, “R1-style Reasoning Models”), feel free to suggest it.

4. Fix formatting, typos, links

Small but helpful contributions are welcome too.

✔ Use concise descriptions

Preferably:
